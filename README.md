Title - Study of rotational and translational motion of objects by high speed imaging technique using MATLAB.

Rotational motion(Calculation of RPM of a fan using high speed camera) - Quads were used on alternate blades of the fan. The rotation was captured using Photron fast cam at 250 and 500 fps respectively. The coordinates of the centre of the quad was tracked at each frame and rpm was calculated using the coordinates and frames elapsed. 

Translational motion - Ongoing

Hardware used - Photron fast camera
Software used - Photron fast viewer
